# CanHaptics Lab 4
### Author: Bradley Rey

This lab was designed to have us familiarize ourselves with PID controlled actuation. This is my first time utilizing a PID controller, and thus there are many outcomes I am aiming for. These include the ability to:

* State several reasons why (and when) controlled actuation could be useful
* Define the core operating principles of a PID controller (defining equations, and the impact of each component)
* Tune a PID controller to be stable and effective
* Describe and fix control issues like uniform updates, integrator windup, delay
* Write a simple program that drives your Haply end-effector to follow a target position

This lab is broken into the assigned five parts, each focusing on an aspect of PID control. At the end, I reflect on some of the previously mentioned points and other learned outcomes.

---

## Part 1
The aim of the first part of this lab is to test out the P controller. Modifying the P value modifies what is known as the _proportional_ control. Here, the idea is that the motor current will be set in proportion to the existing error. Ultimately, the proportional controller can reduce the rise time, increase the overshoot, and reduce the steady-state error. The goals for this part of the lab include (for each goal I will note how it feels on the Haply and any problems that arise):

* Run the code to test the P controller
* Modify the target position
* Modify the P parameter

### P = 0.1
Some interesting findings arose when initially playing with a small value of P=0.1. First, I found that for random targets two things could happen. Either  the target was acquired and stabilized to quite quickly (first gif below), or the actuator would ultimately stay in an _orbit_ around the target if the initial movement missed the target (second gif below). This could easily be corrected, using my hand to very lightly stabilize the actuator. When using my hand, I found that a reasonable amount of force was needed in order to pull the actuator away from the target. A final note I made when exploring this value of P was that if a new random target appeared close to the current location, the actuator would not move to stabilize itself in the centre of the new target. This was peculiar to me, and I was unsure of why this was taking place.

### P = 0.5
As I increased the P value, I noted that the system started to become much less stable, and own its own would not stabilize to the targets. I did experience more force when holding back the actuator from the target. Essentially, as the P controller is trying to more quickly reduce the rise time and steady state error as well as increases overshoot, the force applied is higher than with lower values of P. This can equate to the higher amount of force felt. Although I needed to use my hand to help the actuator stabilize to a target, I did notice an interesting result when the P value was increased. Here, the actuator more perfectly stabilizes onto the target. For example at P=0.1, the centre of the target may be closer to the edge of the actuator’s position. Increasing the P value at this position, the actuator’s position becomes much more centred onto the target. I believe this is due to the decrease in the steady-state error.

### P > 0.5
Even though the radial knob in the GUI given provides room to increase the P value to 4, anything over 0.5 caused significant instability. Random positions would cause the actuator to move almost violently and would never stabilize to a target, even with my hand applying force to the actuator. I did not play with these values for long, as I was worried about damage to the Haply. Below, you can see instability being caused simply by increasing the P value for an actuator that is close to an unchangin target.

## Part 2
The second part of the lab involves manipulating the D, or _derivative_ aspect of the controller. The derivative aims to bring the rate of change of error to 0. This should have the effect of reducing overshooting in the system by flattening the curve corresponding to the amount of error as well as reducing the settling time. The goals for this part of the lab include:

* Add and modify the D component of the controller
	* How does this change the behaviour of the Haply?
	* Are there any problems?

First of all, just using the derivative without the proportional controller does nothing to influence the actuator towards the target. As the derivative is not being applied to a rate of change caused by the proportional control, there is no effect.

### P = 0.1 & D = 1.0
Introducing the D component to the controller helped in stabilizing the system in a more timely manner and reduced the oscillations that could occur around the target. See the gif below. A value of D=0.5 did work, however did not provide a consistent or stable environment. At D=1.0, I noticed a significant difference in the stability of the system. This value of D allowed for the actuator to find the target, although not always centred, without any shaking or other issues. As I explored a range  of 0.5 < D > 1.0, the force that was required to withhold the actuator from the target seemed to lessen with larger values of D.

### P = 0.1 & D >= 1.5
Increasing D further, the main difference I noted is that the actuator moved much slower towards the target. This occurred for both random targets and physically moving the actuator from a current target. At large values of D, the actuator would at times not even make it to the target.

![PDnoreach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradleyrrr/bradleyrrr.github.io/gh-pages/assets/img/PDnoreach.gif)

Lastly, I also found that as D increased, the actuator would move to the target in an increasingly straight shot. However, as D increased I noticed an interesting movement towards the target. For larger values of D it seems that in order to have a relatively straight shot, the direction moved seems to oscillate in small amounts back and forth, constantly updating along the path. A smaller value of D often caused the actuator to make single larger corrections to its path rather than these smaller more volatile corrections.

### P > 0.1 & D >= 1.0
I lastly wanted to see if the D value could compensate for the instability when increasing P seen in the previous section. Ultimately I could not achieve any stability with P>0.1

## Part 3
The third part of the lab involves the final part of the PID controller. That is the I or _integral_ aspect. The integral incorporates a time aspect to the controller. Essentially, if the current force is not bringing the error to zero over a period of time then the integral component of the controller will increase the force needed. Ultimately, the integral should decrease the rise time, and increase the settling time. This can have the effect of increasing the overshoot as well as reducing the steady-state error. I will investigate the following aspects:

* Add the I component to the controller
	* How does this change the behaviour of the Haply?
	* Are there any problems?
* Can I create a stable system that reaches the target?

As before, I wanted to see what the effect of just the Integral part of the controller had on the system. Simply using the integral seems to cause wild actions that just pushes the actuator either to the bottom-left or bottom-right of the available workspace. I was surprised that the actuator seemed uninterested in the target, however when increasing the P value dramatically and using my hand I could get the actuator to oscillate around the target with a wide radius.

Incorporating the Integral value with the other components of the PID controller had interesting effects. Before, using just a PD controller, the actuator may not have centred itself on the target. However, with the addition of the Integral it seems to allow the actuator to keep its motion going until centred. Second, the largest difference when including the Integral component was seen around how quick the actuator corrects towards the target when it gets close. Before, this was done slowly, however with an increasingly large Integral the speed at which the actuator perfects to the centre of the target increased as well.

![PIDspeedtotarget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradleyrrr/bradleyrrr.github.io/gh-pages/assets/img/PIDspeedtotarget.gif)

Lastly, I could feel that as I increased the Integral value, there was an increased amount of force holding the actuator to the target. I believe that this may be due to the decrease in rise time and the increase in the settling time.

### Create a Stable System
Trying to setup a stable system was quite tricky. For a while, I was only able to accomplish a stable system by utilizing a light force applied through holding the actuator. However, when I would let go of the actuator and allow it to move to a new random target I would often get violent movement. Ultimately, the velocity that the actuator would move at was incredibly high when moving to a new random target that wasn’t right next to the previous target. This would often cause the position of the actuators and the position of the actuator in the GUI to become unlinked and off by certain amounts.

I tried to overcome this issue through the Processing code, as I found that Antoine had written in force constraints.  Through the following code I decreased the ranges being constrained

```
fEE.x = constrain(P*dist_X,-4,4) + constrain(I*cumerrorx,-4,4) + constrain(D*diffx,-8,8);
fEE.y = constrain(P*dist_Y,-4,4) + constrain(I*cumerrory,-4,4) + constrain(D*diffy,-8,8); 
```

However, my attempts at further reducing the force the motors could apply did not seem to help in my ability to stabilizing the system.

After talking with Antoine during a lab time, he suggested increasing the Derivative value. As noted in Part 2 of this lab report, the Derivative component can have the effect of slowing down the actuator. This can simulate an almost _dampening_ effect which significantly slowed down the speed and force applied by the motors.

This worked amazingly in ‘dampening’ the system and thus slowing down the actuator’s speed. I used values of:

```
P = 0.05
I = 0.11
D = 2.60
```

I could now move from random points or push away from the target point and watch it effectively stabilize back. As the I value is relatively low, it takes a while for the actuator to correct and stabilize to the centre of the target. While this may not be ideal in a system that has time constraints, for our purposes this satisfies the stability condition and mitigates the hardware limitations of the Haply (i.e. the speed, and drift limitation of the device which is ultimately not designed for position control). The feeling of this when lightly touching the actuator is not the smoothest. As the Derivative his high, I can feel individual movements from the motors.

## Part 4
The fourth part of this lab requires us to incorporate path tracking into our sketch. The goal is for the Haply device to move along the path in a stable manner.

I did this by implementing a circle that iterates around the workspace. This is done in the simulation thread using the `xr` and `yr` variables by defining them as a location based on 0-360 degrees and updates every 200 calls to the simulation thread.

```
if (pathIter % 200 == 0) {
      xr = 0.5*cos(degrees*PI/180);
      yr = 0.5*sin(degrees*PI/180)+.2;
      pathIter = 0;
      degrees += 1;
    }
    if (degrees == 361) {
      degrees = 0;
    }
    pathIter += 1;
```

The PID values needed to be changed from the values used in the previous section. Mainly, the Derivative needed to be greatly reduced in order to minimize jerky movements and allow for a more smooth movement around the circle.

```
P = 0.05
I = 0.15
D = 0.22
```

The system works great, with some minor limitations, in allowing the actuator to continually follow the circular path. The main limitation noted is that sometimes the actuator will push in a vertical or horizontal direction a little more than it should. This leads it to go slightly off the path at times, leading to a stronger correction in order to re-reach the centre of the target.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="p-qW2jbR53s" %}

Holding the Haply’s actuator feels as though there is a strong force or magnet holding the actuator to the target. A lot of force is required to hold back the actuator, and it will quickly correct, an overcorrection at first, as it is _holding_ onto the previous vector, but it quickly adapts when I let go. It also feels quite interesting to just feel the motors working to keep the actuator along the path. 

In order to create a _smooth_ feeling, all values need to remain below or equal to 0.1 This decreases the feeling of little mini corrections taking place constantly and audibly reduces the sound of the motors skipping. If values increase, the path following process seems to skip.

## Part 5
### Set Loop-time
The lats part of the lab entails us manipulating the loop-time parameter. A lower loop-time has the effect of making the system go _faster_. This update is happening at the faster_lower loop-time. This in turn, has the effect of creating a more continuous movement, as updates are happening at quicker rate. 

A larger loop-time seems to add what I would call a /delay_. This often had the effect of overshooting of the target. For example, the target along the circular path would continue to move around, however the actuator would only move every so often. This had the effect of building up error in the system and an incorrect vector towards where the target used to be. I found that this could quickly create an unstable environment for the actuator, as the overshooting taking place quickly needed to be stopped manually. The video below shows the effects of smaller and larger loop-time values.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="jM7pSt6CAgI" %}

In order to compensate for a larger delay, I did find that much smaller Integral and Derivative values could help in the stability of the system. While it helped however, a large loop-time value still led to instability as a whole.

### Random Loop-time
In order to create a random loop-time value, I added a code block that changed the loop-time parameter every 2000 calls to the simulation thread. If the loop-time parameter were to be changed more frequently than this, there would not be as noticeable of an effect.

```
if (loopTimeIter % 2000 == 0) {
	looptime = int(random(50,1500));
      	loopTimeIter = 0;
}
loopTimeIter += 1;
```

Randomizing the loop-time definitely causes unstable conditions. The actuator can be seen either trying to play catchup or having to correct its mistake. By the time the actuator corrects due to a large delay, it more than likely shouldn’t have.

## Reflections
This lab provided a great first-hand experience with PID controllers. Having never implemented or used one, I found the experience using the GUI to be very beneficial, rather than viewing graphs of a system. A PID controller can be very useful when a system needs to remain stable at a targeted value.

For our course project, I see the use of a PID controller being very beneficial in one of our _conditions_ that we are hoping to create. We can hopefully utilize a PID controller by having the Haply follow and remain on a path, leading to force being created when the actuator is pulled from this path.

Many aspects need to be considered when utilizing a PID controller, such as time to the target, variance allowed from the target, etc. Issues can also arise during the use of a PID controller. This can include integral windup and delay. Integral windup is a common issue which can lead to continual overshooting. This sketch used in this lab, incorporated a simple button which could reset this windup, and is a button I used fairly frequently. However, in a normal (day-to-day) system, this is often not an option or desired. For this reason, and in our course project, we can provide solutions. These can include setting bounds to the windup value and resetting it when it crosses these. Finally, delay is another common issue faced when using PID controllers. As we saw in manipulation of the loop-time parameter, this delay can have costly effects. Ensuring and testing that a system can maintain a certain loop-time can provide a more stable system in the long run.

Through this lab, I gained an appreciation for PID controllers and their use cases. The GUI was extremely beneficial in _playing_ with values for the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative control and seeing immediate results. By creating a stable system and a path following scenario, I was able to better understand the relationship of the three elements in a PID controller.
