# CanHaptics Project Iteration 1
### Author: Bradley Rey

## Intro
### Objective
This iteration of our project mainly focused on preliminary setup and exploration that has become the foundation for our future iterations and our proposed outcome. This iteration contained reviewing literature surrounding our topic, modifying the Haply for the purposes of our project, and creating the GUI that will enable us to interact with our final project.

As a secondary objective, we also focused on meeting rather regularly with our group. This was key in allowing us to get to know each other and find meeting times that worked for everyone.

### Motivation
Two motivations arose for this iteration of the project.

First, while we initially had hoped to begin some of the coding for the force feedback, we felt that the motivation of our project was lacking and thus needed some focus (as mentioned in the proposal feedback as well). For this reason some of our time was spent on exploring the literature and sharing our findings with each other to discuss our overall motivations in the project.

Second, while still exploring force feedback through the class lectures and the labs, we wanted to ensure that we had a solid base from which to work when we were prepared to begin exploring the haptics. This is why we took the opportunity to modify the Haply and build our GUI. 

### Approach
Our approach entailed a division of labour based on skills, access to elements needed, and time and commitment constraints. For this reason, I built the pen actuator we are planning to use on our Haply devices, performed literature review, and was apart of the discussion surrounding our GUI. Shariff worked on implementing the pressure sensor, performed some literature review, and implemented the GUI. Finally, Bibhushan worked on literature review, exploring some Processing libraries that could be useful, and discussed the GUI.

## Components of Iteration
Here I discuss the main components of this iteration.

### Haply Modifications
First, as discussed in our proposal we wanted to perform some modifications to the Haply device. These included creating a pen like actuator and incorporating a pressure sensor,  the latter of which Shariff accomplished.

First, the pen actuator was an element that I solely focused on. I recently bought a 3D printer and have minimal experience, although was excited to have the opportunity to create something from scratch. For the design of the pen there were two key aspects I needed to ensure:

* The pen needed to be comfortable to hold and mimic a traditional pen as much as possible
* There should be some angled movement in the pen allowing for a comfortable writing angle

Through some iterations of the prototype pen I was able to develop a pen that satisfied these conditions.

First, the image above shows some of the pen prototypes that I went through. On the left we have the piece that holds the magnetic ball. This first iteration was too tall and allowed for almost no angular movement. In the middle, is the piece that houses the screw that then goes into the metal ball. This piece took me the most time. Initially it was too short for a comfortable hold, as the edge of this piece would dig into your finger. I also needed to find a way to house the extended portion of the pen, thus creating an actual pen size. I did this through iteration of this middle piece and settled on creating an internal octagonal opening. Finally, the pieces on the right are the prototypes for the tall portion of the pen. These are shortened to save time and filament.

Through all iterations I kept the diameter of the pieces to a minimum, being at most 1mm wider than the metal ball which is the largest component.

The final pen prototype can be seen below. First the final pieces of the pen, and second the pen attached to the Haply with me holding the actuator. The pen provides a comfortable feel and allows for a natural writing experience.

### Literature Review
Second, we all performed literature review. This is a critical component of this iteration as we needed to help define a motivation as well as the types of force feedback we would use. The work we are aiming to accomplish is dependent on literature review, more so than other projects may be. Thus, we did focus considerable time on this aspect.

From this we found multiple papers in two main areas of research:
* Haptic Writing
	* Stroke Rehabilitation
	* Child Writing Development
	* Foreign Language Training
* Motor Skill Training

From this literature review we found a couple notable insights.

First, the literature we read helped define the types of force feedback used as well as the ones not. Thus, we plan on focusing on four types of force feedback:
1. Partial Feedback - this incorporates a PID style controller to provide partial feedback when needed to get back on track.
2. Full Feedback - this incorporates strict boundaries, almost like solid walls, to the correct path which always keeps you on path.
3. Anti-Guiding - this method actively pushes you away from the correct path, forcing the user to use strength to keep themselves on the correct path.
4. Nudging or Disturbance - this method provides random forces in random places and at random times. This keeps the user _on their toes_ which has an impact in training.

Interestingly, we found a paper working with some of these forms of force feedback on children learning to write. Their findings suggest that for different complexities of letters (think the difference between the letter ‘i’ and the letter ‘g’) have different increases in performance with different methods of force feedback. If we do try and do a small user study, this will be an important aspect to keep in mind.

From the literature in writing training we also found algorithms for the simple partial and full feedback methods that we should be able to utilize and implement, with some modification. As well, we found a paper which discussed levels of force feedback with levels of force, stiffness and damping. These will be very helpful when it set up the haptic experiences we are going to implement.

Lastly, through our literature review, we found elements that researchers have used to evaluate writing performance which we plan to use if we can. These include simple metrics such as speed, acceleration, pressure, jerk, and force.

### GUI Design
Lastly, we aimed at designing and implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) that we could use for the remainder of the project. Through the use of Google Slides we communally designed an interface we felt was simple and easy to navigate. Below is an image representing the GUI and the Processing sketch version as well.

The main components of this followed closely with another [research work](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1290144.1290161) we found during our literature review. However, we focused on a couple main aspects which differed ours from theirs.

First, we wanted all elements to be contained within a single interface. We did not want to have to force users to move between pages between the haptic experience. Thus, we put all controls, instructions, and feedback on a single screen.

Second, we felt that it was necessary to have the letter to be drawn visible in the workspace in which the Haply can control the cursor that writes. The user will ideally want to trace the letter, and this allows us better control on where and when the haptic feedback should be felt. By visually showing the user the correct path, they can also better understand where and when they perform both positively and negatively.

## Reflect
Through this iteration, we as a group learned many aspects. First, we simply learned to communicate as a group and find times that worked to meet. Second, as we performed lots of literature review, we discovered and explored an area of research that was new to us all. The focus being on haptic feedback used in motor skill training and handwriting training.

While we had initially set out to implement some rough haptic feedback in this iteration, we did not get to this point. That being said, I believe we have set ourselves up for the next iterations leading to a successful final project. Due to commitments and time constraints we satisfied other objectives and put more time into these than we initially thought was needed. With the background work we have done, we are ready to push forward into the next iteration!

Through this iteration, for me, surprising elements and questions arose when exploring the literature. As I am not naturally from a haptics background, exploring this new set of literature was intriguing and interesting. I learned a lot about the types of force feedback used, methods  and algorithms used in the haptic feedback implementations, and the amazing performance haptics can provide in studies exploring writing training. It surprised me that the use of haptics is not as widespread with the results I was seeing. As per questions, one has set in as the most intriguing. This is, can anti-guiding force feedback benefit the training of writing skills? This form of force feedback was not used in any of the papers we found exploring writing training. For this reason, as well as due to its difference from what has been explored in class, I am most looking forward to this form of force feedback.

## Next Iteration
Our next iteration will involve a deep dive into the force feedback methods that we will use. First, we will implement the four types of force feedback as discussed earlier in this post. Second, we will gather some initial feedback from those that we can about the implementations. This will allow us to iterate on and create a pleasurable and effective haptic experience.

Furthermore, as Bibhushan does not have his Haply device yet, we are also aiming to begin writing on the some of the final report. Elements including the introduction, related work, and some of our methods can be written at an early stage.
