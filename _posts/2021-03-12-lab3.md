# CanHaptics Lab 3
### Author: Bradley Rey

## Overview
The final lab for the course involves communicating something via haptics and the Haply device. Haptics, while not often used to convey or communicate complex emotions or feedback, can still be used effectively. Through the use of force feedback and motion control on the Haply, this lab will explore just that. I aim to convey a small set of words through a vocabulary of communicative movements. This communication will only be given through the Haply, thus no visual or audio cues are shown.

## Words and Motivation
The three words (phrases) that I intend to convey are “_nervous excitement, suspenseful tension, and scared_“. These words, and the idea behind creating this set came from a haunted house. If you’ve ever been to a haunted house, and are one to get scared, this may resonate with you.

Whether you understand the metaphor or not, I will lead with an example to set the scene.

Imagine you arrive to a haunted house with some friends. Initially you feel safe as you have merely arrived and are not about to step foot in the house. However, after you pay you make your way to the line. As that line starts to move and you get closer to the entrance, safety takes way of nervous excitement. You start to bounce around, talk to yourself, and maybe make jokes to lighten the nerves.

Finally, the time has come to go into the house. You and your friends make your way inside with a focus on caution. As you make your way further into the house, you know something is coming but you don’t know when and where. This causes you to move with even more caution as you go deeper and deeper into the depths of the house.

Finally, out of nowhere something jumps out at you! You scream! You run! You go anywhere that isn’t right there.

And after all that, for some reason we choose to keep going back year after year!

## Implementation
### Overview and Idea
In order to implement and communicate the feelings mentioned above I first sketched the _scene_ I felt could convey this. 

![sketch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradleyrrr/bradleyrrr.github.io/gh-pages/assets/img/sketch.png)

As we were to use at least two methods, I focused on including the following:
1. Static (non-moving) objects
2. Regions with different dynamics (dampening)
3. Motion guidance of the end effector

The static objects are used in the first part of the communication, that of _nervous excitement_. Here, the idea is that movement will become jerky and interrupted, simulating a bouncing around of sorts.

Regions with different dynamics are used to build the _suspense and tension_ as you move closer to the scary object. Through dampening, the end effector gets much more difficult to move and moves at a slower pace. This simulates the idea that tension and suspense are building up.

Lastly, by moving the end effector, I aim to create the _scared_ feeling which often leads to us running away, assuming the flight response beats the fight response! Here, upon touching the scary object the end effector will shoot back to safety; almost as if you are running for your life!

### Code
In order to accomplish the three sections mentioned above I wrote code to create the objects and areas within the world as well as to move the end effector.

First, for the _nervous excitement_, I have the world built with 70 random boxes. This allows for a jittery and abrupt feel when trying to move through them.

```java
for (int i=0; i<70; i++) {
    FBox temp = new FBox (random(0.5, worldWidth/32), random(0.5, worldHeight/32));
    temp.setPosition(random(worldWidth/8,worldWidth/2.5), random(0,worldHeight));
    temp.setFill(0);
    temp.setStatic(true);
    world.add(temp);
  }
```

Second, I create the dampened areas. This uses stronger levels of dampening as the end effector gets closer to the scary object. When not in this section of the sketch, the user can move quite freely in comparison. Here there is an `if` statement surrounding the dampened code. This allows me to use an `else` statement as well to reduce the dampening when moving the end effector in the final part, which is described next.

```java
if (!hasTouchedScaredBox) {
      if (s.h_avatar.isTouchingBody(damp1))
        s.h_avatar.setDamping(900);
        
      else if (s.h_avatar.isTouchingBody(damp2))
        s.h_avatar.setDamping(950);
        
      else if (s.h_avatar.isTouchingBody(damp3))
        s.h_avatar.setDamping(975);
        
      else if (s.h_avatar.isTouchingBody(damp4))
        s.h_avatar.setDamping(990);
}
```

Finally, upon touching the scary object the user is moved back to the start position, which can be deemed safe. The code recognizes the touch against the scary object setting `hasTouchedScaredBox` to `True` and thus forces the end effector, and reduces the dampened areas, back across to the left side. The force required was determined through some light testing, to get an understanding of the force values at play. This is done in a rapid (but still stable) motion so as to simulate a quick escape. Once the end effector has moved back to _safety_ the forces go back to normal as the `hasTouchedScaredBox` boolean is set to `False`.

```java
if (hasTouchedScaredBox) {
      fEE.set(-s.getVirtualCouplingForceX()+1500000, s.getVirtualCouplingForceY());
    }
    else {
      fEE.set(-s.getVirtualCouplingForceX(), s.getVirtualCouplingForceY());
    }
```

Overall, the graphics look like this which helps get an idea of the sketch that a user would be blindly working through. Here you can visually see the many aspects of this sketch.

The safe area is to the left of the leftmost black bar. This area has no haptic feedback, thus is not represented by a word. The _nervous excitement_ area can be seen next, which has blocks scattered across. The dampened area can be seen, where an increased dampening value corresponds with a darker hue of blue. Lastly, the scary rectangle on the right is what a user touches for the end effector to move back to safety.

## User Feedback
While the goal was to convey the three terms I mention above, the hope is that overall the feeling is quite emotional. I tested our implementation on my two roommates. Each of their thoughts and processes using the Haply and the sketch (which they could not see and no audio feedback was given), is described below.

First, I described to each of them that there were three words, terms, or feelings I was trying to convey. I also described that in my implementation I was trying to convey a bit of a story, and that my words to convey were tied together. I also made sure they started on the left side and knew that the _goal_ was to move in a rightward direction.

### Participant 1
The first participant recognized the different elements, and could describe the overall feeling of the left wall, the objects scattered, and the resistance. One of the first comments they made while trying the sketch, was that the scattered blocks felt like frustration. They mentioned that they just wanted to go right but couldn’t always. They then described the dampened area as something that felt like they were pushing our pulling on something elastic. Once they found the block on the right and were sent back, they immediately said they felt like they were stretching an elastic band and it snapped.

Overall, after testing the sketch a few times, I asked them to provide me with 3 words or terms that they felt the experienced throughout the sketch. First, they said the blocks made them feel **_agitated_** or like I was trying to describe something **_bumpy_**. Second they said the dampened area felt like a **_struggle_**, especially as it increasingly got harder. Finally they described touching the box as **_relief_**!

These were great observations, which I felt tied loosely to my overall theme and word choice.

### Participant 2
The second participant I had was a little more literal in trying to describe the haptic sensations they were feeling. Through the same instruction and a little bit of coaxing, to try and elicit feelings or emotional words rather than descriptors I got the following feedback.

First, they mentioned that the blocks created a maze like feeling. Here, they described as knowing they needed to go right but felt like they were at times blocked and had to back track. There was a level of **_excitement_**, especially once they made it through, but felt **_disappointment_** if and when they were blocked. The second part, involving the dampening, was described exactly as participant 1, with the term **_struggle_**. Finally, and this was probably due to my description of the sketch, but they felt I was trying to convey **_frustration_** when they arrived to the right and were sent back to the safe area.

Overall, these were also great observations and reflects on how certain haptics can convey certain information.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this lab first and foremost as a good challenge, as I often I think of haptics as part of a multimodal system. Therefore, having to convey meaning and a message through the use of only haptics led to some interesting discoveries. Further exploration of the torques and forces at play was also a beneficial experience.

### Quality of Expressiveness
As the participants found some differences and some similarities in the haptic experience, I would call this lab a success! 

The first area provided descriptions of _bumpy, agitated, and excited_. These words can be loosely tied together, and at the very least I can see how the haptic experience might be the same for each of these words. Although VibViz does not represent force feedback, I used the site to check if any haptic sensations were a mix of these three emotions/adjectives. Sure enough there were two vibrotactile sensations which were used to describe these three words. This demonstrates that these words are loosely tied together, and as such it makes sense that one form of haptic feedback may be described as a range of words.

Next, I was very excited that both participants used the same term for the second, resistive, area. Even though _struggle_ does not directly equate to _tension_ or _suspense_, it can again be seen as related. When there is tension, one can often assume there is also a degree of struggle (which when light may not be described as a struggle anymore). I also had the first participant use the metaphor of pulling a rubber band and it snapping, which has underlying tones of tension and suspense if you know it may snap but do not specifically know when. Overall, I was happy with the descriptions used here by the participants.

Finally, the last part of the sketch had the end effector move quickly back to a _safer_ area. Two very different terms were used here, that of _relief_ and _frustration_. I admit that the term frustration was probably given due to my instructions and description of how I laid out my sketch. The term _relief_ however, was one I was pleasantly surprised by when told to me. While I had initially said _scared_, I think that my story was a little too specific for what haptics could define. However, if you look at the underlying feelings of when you get scared, there is a time where relief can wash over you. This occurs after the initial scared reaction, as you come down from the rush of emotion.

Thus through participant testing, I was able to convey certain emotions and adjectives. Initially I had set out to convey “_nervous excitement_, _suspenseful tension_, and _scared_“. However, after testing, I feel I was able to somewhat successfully convey “_agitated_ or _excited_, _struggle_, and _relief_“. While these are different terms, I feel that in regards to haptic exploration these do have many of the same ideals and principles.

While using haptics as a sole modality is not something that often occurs in our lives, this was a great test and lesson in the use of haptics to convey meaning. I feel, and we’ve seen in our readings, that haptics does not allow for as wide a range of expressivity. This could be seen in my results which had responses which were linked to my original words, however the finer details were lost which allowed for precise guessing. Overall, I am happy with the results of this lab. I have learned to think about the underlying principles at play when exploring haptics to convey meaning, and understanding the core emotion that haptics can convey. Rather than attempting to convey a complex story or feeling, focusing on the core emotion can elicit the proper response from a participant or user.
